# Turnstile.rs

A toolkit for build S3-compatible APIs via `object_store`.

## Questions

- Would it be possible to use the same key across multiple distributions of Turnstile? ...

## PoC Needs

- [ ] Download object
- [ ] Validating API keys
- [ ] Counting & logging bytes sent in stream
- [ ] Applying CEL logic

## Workflows

### Stream object from Object Store response body to S3 response

### Count bytes returned in streamed object

### When a user downloads a file, it is logged

### When a user download is logged, aggregate table is updated
